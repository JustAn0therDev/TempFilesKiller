# TempFilesKiller
A Temp Folder directory and file deletion console program in .NET Core.

## Notes
Another program was created to delete the content in the Windows 10 /Temp folder, but that was made with Python 3. You can find it in [here](https://github.com/JustAn0therDev/python_temp_folder_killer). Had some minor trouble executing it because of some Operating System access issues and decided to go with something that was "Microsoft native". It did work better than Python and, although more verbose, it was a lot faster.

If you want to use it, just the change the directory, it should work as long as you execute the published application with Admin privilege.

And if you feel like it, you can give me suggestions, fork the project and make pull requests as well.
