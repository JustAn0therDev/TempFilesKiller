# TempFilesKiller
A Temp Folder directory and file deletion console program in .NET Core.

## Notes
Another program was created to delete the content in the Windows /Temp folder, but in Python. You can find it in [here](https://github.com/JustAn0therDev/python_temp_folder_killer). Had some minor trouble executing it because of some Windows access issues and decided to go with something that was "Microsoft native". It did work better than Python and it was a lot faster, something I did not except (although C# being compiled in .NET and not interpreted should have given me the hint).

I made this for _my_ use, so if you want to use it, just the change the directory, it should work on any other directory (or temp folder of any PC) as long as you open your VS/VS Code or execute the published program in Administrator mode.

If you feel like it, you can give me suggestions, fork the project and make pull requests as well.
